This auto-build sub-package is intended to automate the 
build process for the IOFSL software.  Follow the 
README.git file to set up the proper method for using git 
on semi-secure hpc machines.  If your hpc machine allows
you git access you can choose to clone from there instead.
Please review each script (including build_iofsl).  Edits which
indicate where you have installed dependencies and which dependencies you 
are requiring, may be needed.  
=======================================================================

The "localGitSetup" script should be moved to your home directory
on your local machine, and executed there.
=======================================================================

The "targetGitSetup" script should be moved to your home directory
on your target machine and executed there.
=======================================================================

Following the succesful setup of the git directories execute the 
"build_iofsl" script from your home directory on your target machine.  
=======================================================================

Included with the package is a "runIofslServer" script which can be used 
to launch the server on a host machine after a proper build.  This should
be edited to represent the machine and allocation you are using to submit 
jobs on your hpc machine.
