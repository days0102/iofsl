These Python scripts are Python (2.4) compliant.

Short disclosure on autotests files.
--------------------------------------------------
build_iofsl.py will prepare, configure, make and make-install the iofsl package.  



If configuration fails, config.log will be mailed to the address specified in configure_error.sh.  This should be changed to represent either your own address or the mailing list address.  Currently it is set to rjdamore@gmail.gov. 

Make is not email supported at this time.  

The values in iofsl_values.cfg  must be changed to represent your system, currently they represent the Turing system at LANL.  Section 5, Section 6, and Section 7 in make_IOFSLConfig.py support build_iofsl.py.



startServerTCP.py, run_cunitMD.py and run_cunitIO.py will run the two cunit tests in a two allocation scenario.  startServerTCP.py must be started first on a single allocation and one of the cunit scripts must be started second on a different allocation.  Section 7 in iofsl_values.cfg supports these three scripts.
These scripts are minimal in functionality and I don't know if they will remain in future commits.

build_test.sh is a bash script that does not rely on config files for construction of the IOFSL package.
The build_test.sh script builds, installs, and checks the IOFSL software.  It pulls the latest edition of the IOFSLsoftware
from the git repo.  The options -c and -m refer to the cunit test framework and the mpich2 distribution 
respectively.  The script uses these options to locate those installed dependencies.  The boost and cunit 
dependencies are located automatically since they are not optional.  The dependencies must all be installed in 
the ~/opt directory.  
After installation and construction the script runs a "make check" on the build.  Errors from the make check will
be emailed to the user-email specified in the git global user.email variable.  Configure errors are also mailed 
to the same address. This can be changed easily if the IOFSL-group should be emailed instead.
