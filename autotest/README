The autotest directory contains the basic test-harness for the iofsl distribution.

IOFSL-dist-test.sh:
#################################################
The IOFSL-dist-test.sh script will configure, build and distcheck commits as far back in history as the 
user specifies.  The script has two options, -n and -b.  The -n option referes to the number of commits the user wishes to test into history.  Example:  IOFSL-dist-test.sh -n 10: will test 10 commits backwards in history from the first commit referenced in a git log command.  The -b option refers to the branch the user wishes to execute the test harness on.  If the user wishes to use the master branch it is the default, and therefor no option is required to execute on master.  An implementation that specifies a specific commit is being worked on.  This would allow a user to specify a certain commit or range of commits that he/she wished to execute the test harness on.  More info to follow.

Configure options for building your iofsl package with the test harness, will be located in iofsl/scripts/configoptions.${hostname}.  There is an example configoptions file in iofsl/scripts.

IOFSL-dist-test.sh relies on email_results.sh to send the results of each test that the harness runs.  email_results.sh uses Mutt for sending emails.  If you don't have Mutt, it is easy to install in your home space.

The IOFSL-dist-test.sh script utilizes the runtest.sh script in iofsl/scripts.  runtest.sh is reliant on the $IOFWD_SRCDIR variable being set.
