Instructions:
-------------

export IOFWD_SRCDIR=your_local_git_checkout_dir

Next you need to set the configure options/flags in
scripts/configoptions.your_host_name

== Please do not modify any of the scripts directly and do not commit ==
== any of the configoptions.yourhostname as they are specific to your ==
== system.                                                            ==

Then run scripts/prepush.sh before pushing to the master repository.

Overview:

* scripts/prepush.sh: 
   - will build all revision that will be pushed on git push
* scripts/doeconfig.sh:
  - will configure source tree using options from configfile
* scripts/runtest-rev.sh  <gitrev>:
  - builds and tests the specified git rev (use HEAD for current)
    head of your local branch
    (note: this is NOT does not include uncommitted (local) changes)
* scripts/runtest-range.sh <range>: builds and tests specified range
  - uses runtest-rev.sh internally
* scripts/runtest.sh:
  - will run make distcheck with the correct options
                    (i.e. builds your current source tree)


Logs will be in ${IOFWD_SRCDIR}/buildlogs.
runtest-rev.log will, for each revision tested using runtest-rev.sh, 
contain a line specifying the revision and if it failed or not.

For example:

scripts/runtest-rev.sh HEAD
scripts/runtest-range.sh abc12..bcds23
