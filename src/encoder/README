This library defines a generic encoding/decoding framework.

In its most basic form, it provides a class implementing operator () (someobject);

Depending on the processor, one of the following things can happen:

1) the actual and maximum size of the encoded object is calculated.
2) the object is encoded 
3) the object is decoded

Each processor needs to define operator () for basic types;
The user defines a process (encoder, object) method for derived types.
