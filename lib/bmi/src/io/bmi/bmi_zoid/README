INTRODUCTION


This is a BMI method that runs on top of ZOID, the ZeptoOS I/O Daemon,
running on IBM Blue Gene/P with the ZeptoOS Compute Node Linux.


CONFIGURABLE LIMITS


- ZOID_MAX_UNEXPECTED_MSG (in zoid.h): defaults to 8192, can be adjusted as
  needed,

- ZOID_MAX_EXPECTED_MSG (in zoid.h): defaults to 128M, can be adjusted as
  needed, but is probably already larger than necessary,

- ZBMI_SHM_SIZE_TOTAL (in init.c in ZeptoOS
  packages/zoid/src/zbmi/implementation/ directory): total size of the shared
  memory buffer used to exchange bulk data between the ZOID daemon and the BMI
  server; defaults to 512M.

- ZBMI_SHM_SIZE_UNEXP (in init.c in ZeptoOS
  packages/zoid/src/zbmi/implementation/ directory): part of the shared
  memory buffer used for unexpected messages; defaults to 1M.


LIMITATIONS


This method was specifically developed to address the needs of IOFSL, the
I/O Forwarding Scalability Layer project.  Consequently, not all features
of BMI are supported; we focused on those needed by IOFSL.

Here is a (possibly incomplete) list of the limitations of this method:

- processes on the compute nodes can only communicate with their I/O nodes
  (the compute nodes cannot communicate with each other, neither can the
  I/O nodes; communication is limited to each pset),

- unexpected messages can only be sent from compute nodes to I/O nodes
  (sending from I/O nodes to compute nodes will not work),

- client-side is not multi-thread safe.  It is not easy to make it safe,
  because the lower-level ZOID client-side forwarding if not multi-thread
  safe,

- CTRL-C might be tricky on the client side, as interrupting a ZOID routine
  can deadlock the tree network (this is a ZOID limitation),

- only one, global context is supported.

Additional considerations for the users of this method:

- on the server (I/O node) side, using preallocated (BMI_memalloc) buffer
  can significantly improve performance,

- on both client and server, buffers passed to send/receive routines should
  be 16-bytes aligned (they normally will if they were allocated with malloc
  or BMI_memalloc),

- make sure to use a long timeout for BMI test routines, especially those
  invoked on the client side, as each such call will result in a
  communication with the I/O node (10ms is *way* too short, 1000ms is pretty
  short too),

- to reduce the number of round-trip messages from the compute nodes,
  client-side message post routines can optionally wait (with a timeout)
  and thus increase a chance of an immediate completion.  Use
  BMI_set_info(BMI_ZOID_POST_TIMEOUT, <timeout_ms>) to enable this feature.


ADDRESS FORMAT


The only supported address is "zoid://".  It denotes the server process
running on the I/O node.


IMPLEMENTATION OVERVIEW


The implementation is asymmetric; different code paths are used on the
compute node clients and on the I/O node server.  The main code can be
found in the "zoid.c" file, which contains the client code and the code to
invoke the server routines.  The server routines themselves can be found in
"server.c".

The method source also includes "dlmalloc", a public domain custom memory
pool implementation used to maintain a shared memory pool on the I/O nodes,
and a "zbmi_pool.c" that acts as a wrapper around "dlmalloc".

Both the compute node client and the I/O node server codes actually act as
clients to the ZOID daemon's "zbmi" plugin, which is the most complex part
of the code.  The source of the zbmi plugin is not included here, but is
rather in the ZeptoOS repository, in the
"packages/zoid/src/zbmi/implementation/" directory.  Note that the zbmi
plugin is not documented in detail here, but has its own documentation with
its source code.


IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS

CLIENT

The communication between the compute node clients and the zbmi plugin on
the I/O node is performed using three ZOID-forwarded function calls:
zbmi_send, zbmi_recv, and zbmi_test.

The zbmi plugin is mostly stateless so far as the compute node clients are
concerned.  Specifically, the information on posted expected message
sends/receives that were not immediately completed is stored exclusively on
the client side.

All BMI send routines end up in zoid_post_send_common.  That includes
unexpected messages and list I/O.  This routine attempts to forward the
message to the zbmi plugin on the I/O node, using zbmi_send.  For
unexpected messages, zbmi_send should normally succeed and result in an
immediate completion; however, if the zbmi plugin is out of memory,
zbmi_send will fail with ENOMEM.  The same failure will occur with expected
messages if a matching receive has not been posted on the I/O node side by
the time zbmi_send is invoked.  Either failure is recoverable; the send
request is put in the "zoid_ops" queue for another attempt later.  For
expected messages, if a matching receive has been posted, the call succeeds
resulting in an immediate completion.  zbmi_send normally does not block,
but if BMI_ZOID_POST_TIMEOUT has been enabled, it can, waiting for a
matching expected message post from the BMI server side or for memory to be
released on the BMI server side so that an unexpected message can be
stored.

The way zbmi_send is forwarded by ZOID, the data payload is only
transferred to the I/O nodes if there is memory buffer there for the
message.  So, in spite of how it looks in zoid.c, no bytes are wasted on
the wire.

All BMI expected receive routines end up in zoid_post_recv_common.  This
routine attempts to receive a message waiting in the zbmi plugin, using
zbmi_recv.  If a matching message has been posted on the I/O node side, it
is sent to the compute node and zbmi_recv returns 1, resulting in an
immediate completion.  Otherwise, the receive request is put in the
"zoid_ops" queue for another attempt later.  zbmi_recv normally does not
block, but if BMI_ZOID_POST_TIMEOUT has been enabled, it can, waiting for a
matching expected message post from the BMI server side.

BMI_cancel is very easy to implement thanks to a lack of multi-threading
considerations and because the state is stored on the client-side only: we
just flag a request as canceled.

All BMI test routines eventually end up in zoid_test_common.  The path is
somewhat longer for "testcontext", which first goes through the "zoid_ops"
queue filling in a temporary array with the ids of pending operations
before invoking zoid_test_common.  Again, that would not have been correct
were it not for the fact that we don't deal with multi-threading.  Anyway,
the routine needs to treat canceled requests specially -- those won't be
sent to the server anymore.  For non-canceled requests, it extracts the
message tag, size, and send/recv indicator and forwards those to the server
using zbmi_test.  zbmi_test can block on the server for the specified time
if none of the specified requests is initially ready.  zbmi_test returns
the number of ready requests; if it is non-zero, then the server side must
have posted matching sends/receives, so zoid_test_common next attempts to
satisfy those "ready" requests by invoking zbmi_send/zbmi_recv.  Those
send/recv routines could still fail in spite of a successful test if there
is no memory or if the server side canceled its matching request; this is
recoverable.

SERVER

The communication between the I/O node BMI server and the zbmi plugin of
the ZOID daemon is carried across two channels.  Commands are sent via a
POSIX message queue (zbmi plugin is the server; multiple threads of the BMI
server can communicate simultaneously by opening multiple reply queues to
the server).  Payload is exchanged using a large shared memory segment,
allocated by the zbmi plugin.  We make efforts to avoid unnecessary copies
to/from that segment, so BMI_memalloc() on the BMI server side allocates
from that segment, and ZOID-forwarded zbmi_send/recv calls store their
buffers directly into the segment.

The shared memory segment is split in two: a normally smaller region is
used for unexpected messages and is managed by the zbmi plugin, while a
larger region is used for expected messages and is managed by the BMI
server.

The communication with the zbmi plugin is established during
BMI_initialize, and terminated during BMI_finalize.  The message protocol is
documented in zbmi's zbmi_protocol.h.

For BMI testunexpected, we communicate the metadata on the pending received
messages via the queue, and the payload is in the shared memory buffer
which is returned to the user.  unexpected_free just sends the buffer
address back to the zbmi plugin, since the unexpected messages memory pool
is managed by the plugin.

To get the best performance, it is important that the user allocates
buffers using BMI_memalloc on the server side, because that will allocate
them in the shared memory area.  If instead an externally allocated buffer
is passed to BMI_send/recv, we will allocate a temporary buffer, which
causes an additional copy overhead.  Failures to allocate the temporary
buffer are recoverable: we place the request in the "no_mem" queue and
retry the allocation after every BMI_memfree.

Expected server-side posts, be it sends or receives, can be completed
immediately if a matching client-side post (or test) is waiting when
server-side post is issued.  Note that "immediately" is used liberally
here; the server-side post will not return until the buffer has been
transferred to/from the compute node, which can take some time when the
ZOID server is under heavy load.  For posts not completed immediately we
send a message descriptor to the zbmi plugin which registers the message
and just sends back a confirmation.  When registering we exchange the
internal BMI id and the internal ZOID id, since that simplifies subsequent
testing/canceling.

Canceling messages is more complex than on the client side.  Generally, we
have to send a cancel request to the zbmi plugin to unregister an already
registered message descriptor.  Depending on the progress of the zbmi
plugin in handing that registered request, the cancellation request might
be ignored.  An exception is when the request has not been registered
because of the lack of memory for a temporary buffer as described earlier;
in that case we cancel it locally and put it in "error_ops" queue.

When testing (in zoid_server_test_common), we need to deal with locally
failed/canceled messages separately from the ones registered with the zbmi
plugin.  This is actually similar to what we also do on the client side.
Those messages come from the "error_ops" queue and we deal with them first,
since they involve no communication with the zbmi plugin.  Unlike on the
client side, where the common test routines sort-of "emulated" testcontext
by first building an array of all pending request ids, on the server side
we have a "native" implementation.  Testcontext is recognized by passing an
"incount" of 0, and we forward it to the zbmi plugin so that it knows to
return *any* completed request(s).  This is necessary because of
multi-threading constraints, and it is possible because the zbmi plugin
does maintain state for server-side requests.  The test is the only
server-side command that can block in the zbmi plugin for the specified
time period if no request is initially completed.  Completed requests
require no further handling, with the exceptions of those that used
temporary shared memory buffer, which needs to be released (after being
copied back for receives).  Completed requests can also indicate
cancellations, if we previously canceled a registered request.
