-> allow for testing range versus block-based
-> allow for cache to be blocking
        -> needed in case use static file decomposition
           and need to contact another cache
        -> needed to perform sync on other caches
        -> can be used to make another cache layer that 
           stores data on a local disk
        -> makes cache look no different from a backend filesystem
