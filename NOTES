-> zoidfs_null should return status/information


-> I assume create can succeed without creating the file?
 (i.e. existed already)

-> WOuld be easy if there is an 'invalid' zoidfs handle
--> is there a ZOIDFS root handle?

-> hardlink support?


-> zoidfs_attr_type_t ???


-> zoidfs time_t: posix has nanosecond now

-> statfs missing
-> sync missing

-> zoidfs_setattr: out attr_t?

-> There is more to ESTALE than meets the eye: 
    if it handle->name files while resolving the path 
    in a (parent_handle, component) 
    the caller needs to do a lookup on the parent_handle 


-> Define error values: is it ESTALE or -ESTALE?

-> mode bits?

-> does readdir return . and .. ?
-> dirent cookie too small!

-> what to do with symlinks and lookup?
  (->return handle of destination or return handle of symlink file?
  (currently option 1 since getattr returns symlink attr))

/* for permissions */
-> add zoidfs call to obtain uid/gid of connection
