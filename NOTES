-> zoidfs_null should return status/information


-> I assume create can succeed without creating the file?
 (i.e. existed already)

-> WOuld be easy if there is an 'invalid' zoidfs handle
--> is there a ZOIDFS root handle?


-> There is more to ESTALE than meets the eye: 
    if it handle->name files while resolving the path 
    in a (parent_handle, component) 
    the caller needs to do a lookup on the parent_handle 


-> Define error values: is it ESTALE or -ESTALE?

-> mode bits?

-> does readdir return . and .. ?
-> dirent cookie too small!
